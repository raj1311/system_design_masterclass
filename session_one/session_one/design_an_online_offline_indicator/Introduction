Batch your request whereever possible
get users -> accept as list


Push Based Model :-
* Every 5secs user updates the server with an API to tell it is alive


Pull Based Model :-

* We can't use this here because server doesn't have the context of ip address of client
Example where we use pull is loadbalancers since it knows client details


Only when there is a persisten connection you can speak to client continously and in this case you can use pull model instead of push
