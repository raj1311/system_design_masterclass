First :-


* We tried to keep userID against bool to show online/offline

Cons :-

* If its offline it can't update back and our server still holds as Online


Second :

* Then we tried to keep userId to last online time -> if he is not updated back at 30secs then it is considered as offline

Cons:-

* Data is lot eventhough user has become inactive still entries are there for that

Third :

* So no entries means user is offline
* Hold on to a db which has ttl for the heartbeat seconds
